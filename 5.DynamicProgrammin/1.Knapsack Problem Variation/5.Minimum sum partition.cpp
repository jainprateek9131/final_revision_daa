Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum:-
Given an array arr of size N containing non-negative integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their
sums is minimum and find the minimum difference

Example: 
Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11 
  
Input: N = 2, arr[] = {1, 4}
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
Subset2 = {4}, sum of Subset2 = 4
